# Baker Group Employee Storefront

As a medium-sized employer, Baker Group wanted to create a digital portal for their employees to purchase company-branded apparel and accessories provided by a separate third-party. Better Than Great was approached to design, develop, and host the digital storefront. The turnaround time for the project was tight, but by leveraging pragmatic Agile methodologies and including the client in the process from start to finish, we were able to launch a fully featured eCommerce solution within the timeframe and came in just under budget.

We built this project using the Woocommerce framework, hosted using the Google Cloud Compute engine, and deployed using Jenkins and Github for continuous integration.
