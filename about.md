My Name is Jordan Foreman, and I build stuff for the internet (and occasionally your iPhone).

I'm a jack of all trades/master of none. Designing, Building, and Promoting digital products is what I do. I'm also an aspiring comic book artist and singer-songwriter. When I'm not busy creating new things, I can be found biking, reading, camping, hiking, or laying around watching TV like a real American.
