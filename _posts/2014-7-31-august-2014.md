title: Something Something in the Month of August

August; arguably the best month of the year. I was born in August - barely. Exactly one month from today I'll be 23, and if Blink-182 is to be believed, people are going to up and stop liking me altogether. I'm kinda nervous for that.

Dated pop-culture references aside, I'd like to make a statement about this upcoming August - or rather, a declaration: I'm going to post at least once a day for the entire month.

I know, I know - my last post was somewhere in the ballpark of half a year ago - there's no way right? Probably. I'm terribly inconsistent about creating content. I'd like to change that. I started this blog years ago, and its gone through several iterations since then. However, while I'm great a rebuilding this site - I'm not that great at populating it with content.

Over the next 31 days, I'd like to quickly fill up my content archive with relevant articles - I just need to buckle down and do it. My plan is pretty simple - towards the end of every day, I'll just sit down and reflect on what I've accomplished and what I've learned. Upon reflection, it shouldn't be difficult to produce some helpful content. Maybe one day I post a few paragraphs and the next a few pages; I'm not planning on being super strict here. The goal is to just get myself into the habit.

So there you have it! There's going to be a lot of content coming your way in the next month, and I hope you all enjoy it! If you have any suggestions for things you'd like to read, please sound off in the comments. If I can offer any insight on something, I'll do my best!
