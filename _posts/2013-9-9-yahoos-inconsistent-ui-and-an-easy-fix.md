As I was bumbling around on the internet earlier, I came across a [Yahoo! Groups page](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/dtsearch/conversations/topics/887). My attention was immediately drawn to the two buttons at the top of the page:

Sure, they definitely stand out on this page. If Yahoo! wants user's attention drawn to these buttons, then I suppose that mission could be considered accomplished. However, the design of these buttons seems incredibly inconsistent with the rest of the page (at least to me). Please correct me in the comments below if you disagree, but I think a much more consistent (and still eye-catching) solution would be to simply update the style of these buttons to look as such:

With just a little tinkering in Chrome's DevTools, I was able to convert these buttons to a simple flat design that remains consistent with the rest of the page.

This is just a random musing, and I'd love to hear what other have to say about this. Its a minor UI enhancement that I think Yahoo! should consider investigating in more depth. There are probably many other places where UI is inconsistent across Yahoo!'s massive site-base, so it is definitely something to be aware of.
